# To Do List

This project is a command-line to-do list application implemented in Python. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, deleting, marking as completed, and displaying tasks. The application utilizes CSV (Comma Separated Values) files to store task data, providing a simple yet effective way to persist and manage tasks across sessions.
